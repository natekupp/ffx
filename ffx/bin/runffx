Fast Function Extraction (FFX) toolkit.

Tools:
  runffx test -- given x/y training data and x/y test data, build model then calculate its test rmse 
  runffx splitdata -- split x/y datafiles into separate datafiles for training and testing
  runffx aboutdata -- gives the number of variables and samples for a given x

Usage: runffx splitdata INPUTS_FILE[.csv/.txt] OUTPUTS_FILE[.csv/.txt]
   
Given csv-formatted inputs and outputs files, splits them into training and testing data files
of the form INPUTS_FILE_train.csv, OUTPUTS_FILE_train.csv, INPUTS_FILE_test.csv, OUTPUTS_FILE_test.csv.

Sorts the data in ascending y.  Assigns every fourth value to test data; and rest to train data.

In the csv files, there is one column for each sample point.  The inputs files have one 
row for each input variable.  The outputs files have just one row total, because the 
output is scalar.  Values in a given row are separated by spaces.
